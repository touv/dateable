# dateable
A small library that provides a few very useful methods for date manipulation, including a formatter and a parser.

## Install
	$ npm install dateable
	
## How?
```javascript
var dateable = require('dateable');

var str = dateable.format(new Date(), 'YYYY-MM-DD, hh:mm'); // e.g., 2012-03-24, 22:10

dateable.parse(str, 'YY-MM-DD, hh:mm') // Returns the original date
```

If you want to include text in the formatting, just escape it with either ' or ".

```javascript
var date = new Date(2009, 4, 23)
  , format = 'YYYY "was the year I went to the moon!" D/M "was the date"';

dateable.format(date, format); // 2009 was the year I went to the moon! 23/5 was the date!
```
## Why?
Because dates in javascript are a fucking pain in the ass!
